All the server configurations are available inside the Vagrant file  once you hit
<b>vagrant up</b>
recessary files will be downloading from the internet

While you are in linux terminal you need to navigate project directory and type
<b>npm install</b> to install all the node dependencies

after that you need to install all the bower components while you are in public/javascript directory


after all done 
<b>$ DEBUG=src:* npm start</b>  command will use to start node server.

Thats it
